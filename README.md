# watersheds of code jam

This project is my first js study.

In actual version it contains only the algorithm.

To run tests without input file :
run "mocha test -R spec --recursive"

Tu run tests with an imput file :
- Set input file in root project folder with name B-large-practice.in
- run program with the command "node main.js"
- The output file is put in project folder with name 'output'

Coming soon :
- manage exception
- algorithm as a REST service
- UI in angular 2 to update file, run and watch result
- Add of more unit tests
